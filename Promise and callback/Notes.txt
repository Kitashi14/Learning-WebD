callback{

    while making a function to support callback one can use multiple parameters for callback;
    but while using the function its not required match the numbers of arguments/parameters for the callback;
    but had to match the num of parameters for main function;
}

callback/promise{

    function are not made to support both callback and promise as they are not compatible with each other;
    if made function to support both callback and promise then{

            while using callback method we had to handle promise rejection err;
            while using promise method we had to provide a fake callback function to match the no. of arguments of the main function;
    }
