NEW KEYWORDS{

    ORM{
        object relational mapping;

        we generally use ORM tools to write sql codes in oops format;
        we don't usually write raw sql codes;

        eg. sequelize for javascript, sqlAlchemy for python, etc.
    }
}

NOTES{

    can use drawsql.app for making chart;
}

MySQL{

    about{

        relational database;
        structured query language;
        it helps in performing different operations on the relational data present in database;

        sequel database;
        requires a Schema which have proper rules defined for its data;
        scaled vertically;
        writing data is easy while fetching will take some time;

        good for database with many relationships like shopping Carts, Contacts, Networks;

        no duplicate data is present (bad practice) unlike in NoSQL databases;
    }

    authentication{

        mysql v8 (the version installed in my pc) supports multiple authentication methods for accessing the db;
        by default caching_sha2_password method is used in v8 (due to this sudden change many previous modules and tools are having problem in connecting to db);
        earlier mysql_native_password was used (for f*cking 24 years);

        //for changing the authentication method to previous on
        //code in mysql interface
        ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '<password>'; 
    }
    
    Datatypes{

        a coloumn of variable data have a datatype defined for it;
        eg. int, float, varchar, text, datatime, etc.;
    }
    
    Constraint{

        a coloumn may have constraint defined for their data;
        eg. unique, not null, primary key, enum, etc. 
    }

    other keywords{

        create, table, select, where, etc;
    }

    codes{

        //command line
        mysql --version
        mysql -u <username> -p      //then enter your password to access mysql cmd line interface

        //inside mysql comand line interface
        show databases;                     //using colon at the end is must
        create database <db name>;
        use <db name>;
        show tables;
        -- <comment>;    // we can use '-- ' to write comments in sql;


    }
